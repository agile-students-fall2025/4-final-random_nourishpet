# NourishPet

## Project Description

**NourishPet** is a web application that transforms nutrition tracking into an engaging, game-like experience.  
Users “raise” a virtual pet that thrives when they make healthy food choices — turning meal logging and wellness tracking into a source of motivation and fun.

## Team History

We are a team of students collaborating on a class project for Agile Software development.  
During ideation, we chose to create **NourishPet** because we wanted to bring our creativity and lightheartedness to the difficult realm of nutrition. We hope to integrate technology, design, and behavioral psychology to promote healthier habits.  
We're hoping to practitce the Scrum framework, with sprint-based milestones, spikes, and task boards managed via GitHub Projects.
